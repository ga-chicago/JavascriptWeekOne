Control flow, boolean, variables dataTypes

#### 1. Data Types

Create the following variables and in a comment after the variable, state the type that it is. If you are unsure of the type, use the function `typeof` to find it out. Note that some types may not be what you expect...

* The number that represents *pi*.
* Your full name.
* A list of prime numbers.
* The number 87
* If you are taking WDI or not.

#### 2. Array Manipulation

* Create an array.
* Add 3 places you have visited in your life.
* Remove two of them from the front of the array.
* Add 3 places that you would like to travel to.
* Remove one of them from the end of the array.
* Change the value of the second index to Japan.
* Change the first string in the array to Where am I going?
* add the number 8 to the end of your array.


#### 2. Conditional Trials

* Create a function that detects if a user is able to purchase alcohol.
* If so, `console.log` out that they may have a drink.
* Else, warn them via `console.log` to not break the law.

#### 3.

Create a function that take an integer (in Fahrenheit) and convert the temperature to Celsius.
The output of the program should read: "X degrees Fahrenheit is Y degrees Celsius"

Remember you can test all of these in the javascript console in the browser!

1.  `git add .`
2.  `git commit -m "a message"`
3.  `git push origin master`
